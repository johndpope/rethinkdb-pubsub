## What is it?

Implementation of message queueing on top of RethinkDB changefeeds as a library.
Essentially this is a rewritten pubsub (with added unit tests) library from [example-pubsub](https://github.com/rethinkdb/example-pubsub/tree/master/javascript) repository.

See more info in this article: [Publish-Subscribe with RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/publish-subscribe/javascript/).
